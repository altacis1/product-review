### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- I learned how to switch between grid and flex properties. Also i learned about the <picture> tag which enables me to switch to different images on certain screen size. IT'S AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! (ps. i learned it on kevin powel hehe)

### Challenges
- The very challenging part was that the image was not taking the whole width of its parent container. I just put a fixed width to fix it.
